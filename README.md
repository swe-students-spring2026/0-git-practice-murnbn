# IT Workers' Unemployment Rate Climbs in 2025

[IT Workers' Unemployment Rate Climbs in 2025](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/it-workers-unemployment-rate-climbs-2025#:~:text=Federal%20labor%20data%20showed%20joblessness,on%20the%20IT%20job%20market.)

There are approximately **152,000 unemployed IT professionals**, and the IT job market shrank by more than **171,000 jobs** over the previous 24 months, representing flattened growth, the firm said. 

But in other areas of healthcare, the opposite problem – knowledgeable tech worker shortages – has posed challenges. **Software engineers and developers, data analysts and scientists, and security IT professionals roles are all in high demand.**

## Valeria Chang's comment
I found this article really interesting because it highlights a contradiction in the tech industry right now. On one hand, there are over 150,000 unemployed IT professionals and an overall decline in IT job growth. On the other hand, specialized areas like healthcare technology are experiencing strong demand for roles such as software engineers, data analysts, and cybersecurity professionals. This contrast shows how important adaptability and specialized skills are in software development. It’s not just about being in tech, but about understanding which industries and problem areas need technical solutions the most. Healthcare in particular seems to be a space where technology can have a meaningful real-world impact while also offering strong career opportunities.
